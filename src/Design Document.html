RunnerSchedule.java
1.Make a new object called input with a default constructor.
2.Call the toString() method to introduce the basic rule and instruction to the user.
3.Ask the user to type in their morning schedule, if it is too stressful, then the
program will ask the user to fix their schedule until it's healthy. Stored the healthy schedule
to a String variable called morning.
4.Ask the user to type in their noon schedule, if it's too stressful, then the program will let
the user fix their schedule until the program think it's healthy.Stored the final user input to
a String variable called noon.
5.Ask the user to type in their afternoon schedule, if it's not reasonable, then the program
will ask the user to fix their schedule until it's healthy. Stored user's final input to a String
variable called afternoon. Create another object called input2 that take the value of
afternoon as parameter.
6.Ask the user to type in their evening schedule, if it's too stressful, the program will ask
the user to type in another evening schedule until it is healthy. Stored the final user input
to a String variable called evening.
(The program will check whether the user's input is a valid input or not for step 3-6, if the
user typed in something that's considered invalid, the program will ask the user to type again,and
address why their input is not valid.)
7.Finally print out the revised schedule for different time period of the day.
